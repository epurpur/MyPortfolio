                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a Research Librarian at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. I am looking to leverage my 
                 Geographic Information System (GIS), data analysis, and web development skills together. I enjoy any project that challenges me but I love maps! I specialize in web mapping applications and data visualization.</p> 
                <p>I grew up in Boone, NC. In my free time I love to be outside, especially rock climbing or skiing. I also like learning foreign languages, personal finance, and spending time with my girlfriend. I am a cat person and I don't need coffee to wake up early.</p>

                        <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework. The app analyzes datasets in various ways using the python libraries <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> before returning the data to the front-end.
                        The user interface allows users to modify their view of the data on the fly and displays it using <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">HighCharts</a>, a javascript plotting library.

                        <p>This is a python plugin built for the Open Source GIS software, <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>. EcoValuator was built for <a href="http://www.keylogeconomics.com/">Key-Log Economics</a> to be used as a simple means of analyzing land valuation
                        throughout North America. Using the <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html">QGIS Python API</a> (PyQGIS), the plugin takes publicly available land use/land cover data, analyzes it, and returns a view of land value 
                        by various parameters in the user's study area. It is <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ecovaluator/">freely available for download</a> by any QGIS user.</p>

                        <p>Since 2018 I've collaborated with <a href="https://boonerealestate.com/">Boone Real Estate</a> to improve and manage a direct-mail marketing campaign. I set up a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database and used 
                        python scripts as well as PostgreSQL's <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> spatial extension in order to clean the large dataset (~230k records). I later
                        integrated this data into the company's <a href=" https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> instance and configured <a href="https://www.geopointe.com/">Geopointe</a>, a native Salesforce mapping extension, to visualize the data spatially. 
                        This allows for easier integration with the company's direct-mail workfow and management of its internal data.</p>

                        <p>A streetlight network is a large investment in resources and infrastructure for any city. The City of Charlottesville, Virginia was looking for an improved way for city employees to manage its streetlight utilities. Light Cville is a full-stack <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"> Node </a> 
                        application built on the MVC Framework. It has a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL </a> database and <a href="https://sequelize.org/">Sequelize ORM</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/"> Express </a> server and restful API, and <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars </a> templating engine for server side rendering.
                        The front-end utilizes the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> mapping library and <a href="http://tabulator.info/">Tabulator</a> to render the data table. </p>

                        This project has evolved over time into a python <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> application that allows users to check the weather conditions at around 500 climbing locations globally 
                        using weather data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a>. The map is implemented with <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview"> Google Maps Javascript API</a> and location data is stored in a lightweight
                        <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> back end.

                        National Historic Sites, National Monuments, etc. The site uses Google's <a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a> CSS, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> javascript mapping library, and <a href="https://jqueryui.com/"> jQuery UI</a>
                        for some of the UI components. All data is fetched from the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm">National Park Service API</a>.

                                The bootcamp has been grueling but I have learned a ton and am overall enjoying it! But I am looking forward to graduation day on August 6.</td>

I have actually wanted to run this race for a long time.  
                                Sarah had suggested we sign up for a marathon so we signed ourselves up. Since running the Rivanna trail (~20 miles) I have developed an overuse injury in my right achilles which is affecting my confidence and also my ability to prepare.
